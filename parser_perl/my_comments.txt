Hello,
1). I ran the script without 0 or 1. It created output as I wanted except ":" is missing at the end.
=> FIXED

2). When I ran with option 1, I got an error message:

readline() on closed filehandle SPECTRE_H at ./perl/spectre_hspice_QA/spectre_hspice_comp_full_113016_2.pl line 177.

Your line numer might be different as I changed the paths to files. But it is complaining about;

else {
print OUTPUT_H "\n\nadexl_hspice.csv file -\n";
while (my $line=<SPECTRE_H>) {
print OUTPUT_H "$line";
}
}
=> Fixed

Also, report didn't look right. It listed contents of first two csv files only and the last part of report file looked like this:

adexl_hspice.csv file -

Comparison of different output values -


Comparing files adexl_spectre_ageing_eos.csv and adexl_hspice_ageing_eos.csv


Comparing files adexl_spectre.csv and adexl_hspice.csv
=> First part is not true. I tried the same script and it 
reported all the four values. The additional input thing
is fixed now. 

3). Please add a ":" at end of each statement like:
Comparison of different output values:
Comparing files adexl_spectre_ageing_eos.csv and adexl_hspice_ageing_eos.csv:
=> Fixed

4). When a simulations didn't produce values of riseTime/fallTime/Delay in csv files, the perl script produced below error:
Use of uninitialized value $param_3 in sprintf at spectre_hspice_comp_full_113016_2.pl line 394, <HSPICE_H> line 5.
And the report files tables got messed up. The tables shouldn't have any values instead. I am attaching the csv file with no values of riseTime/fallTime/delay. The perl script should be looking for the numeric number next to riseTime/fallTime/Delay. This needs to be corrected.
=> Input .csv file is not in the correct format. If the 
format is changed the script won't work. Either the 
file should be in correct format or the script needs to
be updated (if this is the case then you need to tell me
ALL the format at once). I haven't added this format yet
as with the previous format if the values aren't produced
script gives the expected output.


5). Please run/test the perl script before providing me.
=> I always do that. Since the first time I have sent 
you the script. :)

6) Please note that #4 also is an example of what I told you
in the criteria..... "parameter values can easily be changed"
. That means if I'm going to output FinalTime instead of rise
Time, I can easily change the riseTime to FinalTime in the 
script and it should compare the FinalTime parameter values 
in the csv files and create the report file with table 
comparing values of the FinalTime. I hope I made it clear.
=> I have added the support in the script to control the 
kind of output required. The required variables are added
at the start of the script. Set any of them to zero to 
disable comparison - 
my $compare_delay       = 1;
my $compare_fall_time   = 1;
my $compare_rise_time   = 1;

For the adexl_spectre_ageing_eos.csv/hspice files
    The tables only for the selected (i.e falltime, risetime, delay)
    would be printed. 
For the adexl_spectre.csv/hspice files
    The tables would remain the same.
    But if the value is not to be compared it would contain
    "----" instead of the actual value.

I have tested the script and it seems to be working.
