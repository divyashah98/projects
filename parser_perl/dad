Hey, Sorry, I have one question there is command for reconfiguration: 
system ("tacmd setagentconnection -n agentlabel:NT -a -p PROTOCOL1=IP.SPIPE IP_SPIPE_PORT=3660 SERVER=rtems_ip BPROTOCOL1=IP.SPIPE BIP_SPIPE_PORT=3660 BSERVER=backup_rtems_ip"); 
in reconfig_win function we pass variables for both SERVER and BSERVER. 
my $rtems_ip = $_[0]; 
my $backup_rtems_ip = $_[1]; 
But we need variable for agentlabel as well. agentlable should be an ipaddress of the agent from 
the eplist file. it's the second column in the line. In fact, when you parse the eplist file you save that ipaddress of the agent for 
push (@{$ip_rtems[$i]}, $ip_arr[$j]); 
we need to put for agentlabel that ip of the agent. 
in the meantime it's $rtems_ip in reconfig_win function. 
for SERVER in reconfiguration command we need to put just the name of RTEMS from 5th column in line from eplist file. 

Seems I explained in a bad manner the meaning of each column in eplist file. 
for Backup RTEMS in reconfiguration command we can skip it. 
it look like 
system ("tacmd setagentconnection -n agentlabel:NT -a -p PROTOCOL1=IP.SPIPE IP_SPIPE_PORT=3660 SERVER=rtems_ip BPROTOCOL1=IP.SPIPE BIP_SPIPE_PORT=3660 BSERVER=NO");

if we get variable for RTEMS from 5th row, we need to put in reconfiguration command for SERVER 
variable the hostname of RTEMS without "RTEMS" e.g. we have a line in eplist file 
uuc_ushpmqwss1g:IS;10.58.143.9;ushpmqwss1g;Win2008~6.1-SP1;REMOTE_usitmdl8101;IS;07.40.01;Y 
not REMOTE_usitmdl8101. we need to split this and get usitmdl8101. also can be ip address, 
but there is no sense to do it because all DNS resolves by HUBTEMS
