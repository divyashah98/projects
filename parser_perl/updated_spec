Here is the final spec.
Attached are 4 .csv output files. The .mt0 files are replaced by .csv files.

1. Now using .csv files instead of .mt0
(Note: for better viewing, you can use "gnumeric filename.csv" linux command)
2. Perl script should have capability to change parameter names and parameter numbers easily in the script. 
for example: Delay, riseTime, fallTime, etc
3. Perl script should have 2 options for comparison (can be easily changed in the script):
a. report file contains the complete contents of .csv files for both spectre and csv
b. report file contains values for parameters (Delay, riseTime, fallTime, etc) for spectre and hspice
4. More level of comparison is needed. You can see "adexl_spectre_ageing_eos.csv" and adexl_hspice_ageing_eos.csv. 
For better viewing you can use "gnumeric" unix command. Think like an engineer and see how would you report 
differences between the two files. You will notice that there are six lines of "Delay": three of them for "age" 
and three of them for "eos". And both "age" and "eos" has one more level which can be "stress", "fresh" "10 yr". 
Same way six lines for "FallTime" and "RiseTime" with similar format. So the report should clearly report all these 
differences. One way to report these would be like:

Pass/Fail report first, then comparison.....
